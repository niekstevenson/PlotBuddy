\title{Plot with Optimal Legend Placement}
\usage{
auto_legend(x, y, legend_text, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of x-coordinates for the plot data.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of y-coordinates for the plot data.}

\item{legend_text}{A character vector specifying the legend text.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the \code{\link{plot}} and \code{\link{legend}} functions.}
}
\value{
This function generates a plot and places a legend optimally along the edges.
It also prints information about the legend's position (both normalized and original coordinates)
and the radius of the largest empty circle found.
}
\description{
This function plots a given dataset and places a legend in the emptiest space
along the edges of the plot. The position is determined by iteratively
finding the largest circle centered along the edges that does not touch any
plot points.
}
\details{
The function determines the optimal legend position by:
\enumerate{
\item Normalizing the data coordinates to the \link{0, 1} range.
\item Iteratively growing circles along the plot edges until the largest
circle that does not overlap any data points is found.
\item Adjusting the legend position to fit within the plot bounds, considering
the legend's width and height.
}

\examples{
# Example usage:
set.seed(123)
x <- 1:1000
y <- x + rnorm(1000)
auto_legend(
  x, y,
  legend_text = "test",
  col = "black", pch = 1
)
